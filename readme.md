"I've created a simple yet effective web page to keep a record of all my Medium blog posts. This tool allows you to add blog titles and URLs, generating a dynamic list of hyperlinks for easy access. Each blog entry is automatically numbered, and you can easily manage your list by adding new entries or deleting existing ones with a single click. The tool also uses SweetAlert to confirm deletions, ensuring you don't accidentally remove an entry. All data is stored locally in your browser, so your list remains persistent even if you close or refresh the page
